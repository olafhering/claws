/*
 * Claws-contacts is a proposed new design for the address book feature
 * in Claws Mail. The goal for this new design was to create a
 * solution more suitable for the term lightweight and to be more
 * maintainable than the present implementation.
 *
 * More lightweight is achieved by design, in that sence that the whole
 * structure is based on a plugable design.
